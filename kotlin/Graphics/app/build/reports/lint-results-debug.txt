/data/data/com.termux/files/home/InnerCode/Command/kotlin/Graphics/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:14: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 31 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
        tools:targetApi="31">
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.
